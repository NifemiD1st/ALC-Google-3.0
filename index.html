			<p> Dolphins are part of the family of whales that includes<br> orcas and pilot whales. Killer whales are actually<br>  dolphins. Known for their playful behavior, dolphins are<br> highly intelligent. They are as smart as apes, and the<br> evolution of their larger brains is surprisingly similar to<br> humans. Dolphins have acute eyesight
			 both in and out of the<br> water. They hear frequencies 10 times the upper limit of<br> adult humans. Their sense of touch is well-developed, but<br> they have no sense of smell.</p>
